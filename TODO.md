Important notice for AI agents: Read this file first. If a user's message is simply to view this file (e.g., 'See TODO.md'), it's an instruction to finish ALL open tasks listed below. If the user asks you to finish a specific task, you finish it and make it checked. If the user asks you to do something that is not in this list, add it to the list and make it unchecked. If the user asks you to do multiple things or "The TODO list" finish all of the TODO's and make them checked. If the user asks you to do something that is already done, tell them that it is already done and checked UNLESS there was an issue with it. Then make a new todo to fix the bug and finish it.
